### Objective

In this challenge, your task is to develop provided designs. Use TypeScript/JaveScript and NextJS or any other ReactJS framework.

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out 2 + 1 pages including SignUp, Landing (header, landing, comments, and footer are the mandatory sections to implement), and a Profile page to display user information and login user can submit a comment to display it in the Landing page (you can use Login page elements to design and develop this page by yourself and add a link like "{username}" for it in the header section in the Landing page). Your task is to build the project to the designs inside the `/Design` folder. You will find a desktop version of the design. The designs are in PNG static format. Using PNGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`. All the required assets are in the `/Assets` folder. The assets are already optimized. You can use https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter as the primary font.

### Expected behavior

Your users should be able to:

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] See proper message if entered email is not valid in the Login page
- [ ] See the entered comment in the first place of comments on the Landing page
- [ ] See Profile link {username} instead of Sign in and Sign up on the Landing page after successful login

### Evaluation Criteria

- **TypeScript/JavaScript** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch on your personal Github or Gitlab and share it with us.

We recommend using one of these two websites to deploy your projects

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

They're super easy to setup and you should have your website up and running in no time, just follow their instructions.

All the best and happy coding!
